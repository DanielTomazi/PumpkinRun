Do you know when you're offline, and that dinosaur game appears with the jumping obstacles? The Pumpkin Game is a game I created inspired by that, using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML/CSS. The game consists of traveling as far as possible without being hit by enemies that come toward you.
***
In the game, there are both ground and flying enemies, which increases the difficulty level as you need to overcome obstacles on the screen.
